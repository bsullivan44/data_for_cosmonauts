# Data For Cosmonauts ! :boom: :star2: :star: :dizzy:

An introductory course on the world of data science and machine-learning for cosmonauts. The real purpose of the course though is evidential thinking with data. The method will be those conventional to data-science and machine-learning.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this course is introduce Marxists and comrades to evidential thinking, in the use of data science and machine learning. 

* Marxists and comrades are often  acquainted with statistics, they read economics, history, they use historical evidence to weigh in on academic and public political debates. They are sophisticated reasoners. 

* Therefore the course was designed to help political persons, persons who by their practice, constantly make arguments and points, by teaching a new set of statistical-computational tools to further substantiate these propositions. 

## Syllabus

* The course will consist of 5 courses, once every week unless otherwise scheduled, on a date to be decided by the participants. There will be a cap on how many can participate as students since instructors will work intimately with each person to make sure students actually learn. For now the cap is 20. There will be tiny assignments to do to drill in the information but they are also voluntary. The courses will occur over zoom and will last a full two-hours or more, in order to not speed and enjoy ourselves.

### Definition 

Let us analyze it in terms of two definitions:

1. functional 
2. learning machines 

The proverbial bible of machine learning, "Introduction to Statistical Learning", never really defines machine learning, aka statistical learning. 

They begin with an example... then conclude "in essence statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f". However, this is patently false and it is incredible that it is stated. We will come to understand why.

I found a better definition, and vision, for the whole programme and metholdogy of machine learning in "Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data". Here, the author takes a step back from the mathematical aspect, and tells us "". I like this much more. We are not always trying to generate model that can predict an outcome. In fact, what is most special and promising about machine learning is unsupervised learning, a whole series of tasks that do not make conventional statisitical assumptions, are non-parametric, and give us the ability to derive insights beyond those afforded by prediction.
