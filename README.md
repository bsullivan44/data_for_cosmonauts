# Data For Cosmonauts ! :boom: :star2: :star: :dizzy:

An introductory course on the world of data science and machine-learning for cosmonauts. The broader purpose of the course is evidential thinking with data. The methods taught will be those conventional to data-science and machine-learning.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this course is introduce Marxists and comrades to evidential thinking, in the use of data science and machine learning. 

* Marxists and comrades are often  acquainted with statistics, they read economics, history, they use historical evidence to weigh in on academic and public political debates. They are sophisticated reasoners. 

* Therefore the course was designed to help political persons, persons who by their practice, constantly make arguments and points, by teaching a new set of statistical-computational tools to further substantiate these propositions. 

## Syllabus

* The course will consist of 5 courses, once every week unless otherwise scheduled, on a date to be decided by the participants. There will be a cap on how many can participate as students since instructors will work intimately with each person to make sure students actually learn. For now the cap is 20. There will be tiny assignments to do to drill in the information but they are also voluntary. The courses will occur over zoom and will last a full two-hours or more, in order to not speed and enjoy ourselves.

## Requirements 

We will be using git, python, a suite of libraries in python, and jupyter notebook to write and run the code in. Therefore, You will need to install on your local machine:

* Anaconda distribution
* Git

Go to 0-introduction to look for instructions on how to install.

## Data-Science

### Definition

#### The Elements of Data Science

Data science is not a self-contained and static discipline, set of methods, or even philosophy. The constitutive interdisciplinarity recalls the famous Lenin quote of Lenin on Marxist theory in "The Three Sources and the Three Components of Marxism": 

*But this is not all. The history of philosophy and the history of social science show with perfect clarity that there is nothing resembling “sectarianism” in Marxism, in the sense of its being a hidebound, petrified doctrine, a doctrine which arose away from the high road of the development of world civilisation. On the contrary, the genius of Marx consists precisely in his having furnished answers to questions already raised by the foremost minds of mankind. His doctrine emerged as the direct and immediate continuation of the teachings of the greatest representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.

The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.*

## Machine-Learning

### Definition 

Let us analyze it in terms of two definitions:

1. functional 
2. learning machines 

The proverbial bible of machine learning, "Introduction to Statistical Learning", never really defines machine learning, aka statistical learning. 

They begin with an example... then conclude "in essence statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f". However, this is patently false and it is incredible that it is stated. We will come to understand why.

I found a better definition, and vision, for the whole programme and metholdogy of machine learning in "Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data". Here, the author takes a step back from the mathematical aspect, and tells us "". I like this much more. We are not always trying to generate model that can predict an outcome. In fact, what is most special and promising about machine learning is unsupervised learning, a whole series of tasks that do not make conventional statisitical assumptions, are non-parametric, and give us the ability to derive insights beyond those afforded by prediction.
