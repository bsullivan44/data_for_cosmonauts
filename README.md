# Data For Cosmonauts ! :boom: :star2: :star: :dizzy:

An introductory course on the world of data science and machine-learning for cosmonauts. The broader purpose of the course is evidential thinking with data. The methods taught will be those conventional to data-science and machine-learning.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this course is introduce Marxists and comrades to the use of data science and machine learning. 

* Marxists and comrades are often acquainted with statistics, they read economics, history, they use statistical, economic, and historical evidence to weigh in on academic and public political debates. They are sophisticated reasoners. 

* Therefore, the course was designed to teach statistical-computational tools to help political persons substantiate their arguments and points.

## Syllabus

The course will consist of 5 module. They will occur once every week unless otherwise scheduled. The course will begin on a date to be decided by the participants and will take place on weekends. 

The folliwing table records the content and schedule: 

Week | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | #5 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |---|
| **Material** |Introduction to Course | Introduction to Python | Basic Statistics and Visualization | Regression and Classification | Clustering | 

There will be a cap on how many can participate since instructors will work intimately with each person to make sure things are set up and students actually get something out of the experience. For now the cap is 20. 

The courses will occur over Zoom, will last a full two-hours or more.

Registration is through the [Cosmonaut Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cosmonautmagazine). A doodle will be sent out to vote for a start date and class time, along with the zoom link. Please donate and support the project! 

## Requirements 

We will be using git, python, a suite of libraries in python, and jupyter notebook to write and run the code in. Therefore, you will need to install on your local machine:

||
| --------------- | 
| Anaconda distribution| 
| Git | 

Go to [0-introduction](https://github.com/Djamil17/data_for_cosmonauts/tree/master/0-introduction) and read the README.md to look for instructions on how to install.

## Data-Science

### Definition

#### The Elements of Data Science

Data science is not a self-contained and static discipline, set of methods, or research programme. The constitutive interdisciplinarity recalls the famous Lenin quote of Lenin on Marxist theory in ["The Three Sources and Three Components of Marxism"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm):

*But this is not all. The history of philosophy and the history of social science show with perfect clarity that there is nothing resembling “sectarianism” in Marxism, in the sense of its being a hidebound, petrified doctrine, a doctrine which arose away from the high road of the development of world civilisation. On the contrary, the genius of Marx consists precisely in his having furnished answers to questions already raised by the foremost minds of mankind. His doctrine emerged as the direct and immediate continuation of the teachings of the greatest representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.*

*The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.*

Now, I doubt many Marxists want to claim Marxism is omnipotent, even though they consider it largely true. And data science is not even the sort of the subject for which omnipotent applies. Certainly no data scientist is omnipotent. Yet, taking this quote for its best aspects, if we were to make an analogy, data science is at the intersection of developments within three contemporary disciplines i.e. computer-science, statistics, and domain-knowledge. Figure 1 shows this.

The first two are both too common and too hard to define. What is meant by domain-knowledge is that for instance if the data scientist is tasked with attempting to predict chemical reactions between elements and molecules from a table of features about those molecules and elements then they must have *scientific knowledge of the elements and molecules, which in the extreme means knowledge of contemporary chemistry*. Such knowledge will be crucial in understanding how to pre-process the features, what models to select, and assessing the results of analysis. That means both assuring the coherence of the results, but also the deeper scientific insights to derive from the "numbers". 

## Machine-Learning

### Definition 

Let us analyze it in terms of:

1. Functions 
2. Learning Machines 

The proverbial bible of machine learning, "Introduction to Statistical Learning", never really defines machine learning, aka statistical learning. 

They begin with an example... then conclude "in essence statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating ***f***". However, this is patently false and it is incredible that it is stated. We will come to understand why.

I found a better definition, and vision, for the whole programme and metholdogy of machine learning in "Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data". Here, the author takes a step back from the mathematical aspect, and tells us "". I like this much more. We are not always trying to generate model that can predict an outcome. In fact, what is most special and promising about machine learning is unsupervised learning, a whole series of tasks that do not make conventional statisitical assumptions, are non-parametric, and give us the ability to derive insights beyond those afforded by prediction.
